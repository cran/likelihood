test1   Calculation of likelihood on a simple non-neighborhood model.
test2   Calculation of likelihood where the model function calls two sub-functions.
test3   Calculation of likelihood where the probability distribution function calls a sub-function.
annealing1 Performs simulated annealing of a simple model.
annealing2 Performs simulated annealing of the model in test3.
annealing3 Unbounded (global) search of the model in test1.
annealing4 Unbounded (global) search of the model in test3.
